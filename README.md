Features of the Project

Core Functionalities: Add Tasks: Users can enter tasks and add them to the list. Edit Tasks: Users can modify tasks after adding them. Remove Tasks: Tasks can be deleted using a remove button. Mark Tasks as Completed: A simple click toggles the "completed" state (with strikethrough styling).
New and Advanced Features: Priority Levels: Tasks can have low, medium, or high priority, visually distinguished by color-coded borders. Dark Mode Toggle: Users can switch between light and dark themes, with the preference saved in LocalStorage. LocalStorage Persistence: Tasks (and their statuses) are saved in LocalStorage, ensuring tasks remain even after refreshing the page. Animations & Transitions: Smooth CSS transitions for toggling themes and task actions enhance the user experience. Structure of the Project HTML: A simple interface with an input field, task priority dropdown, buttons to add/remove/edit tasks, and a dark mode switch.
CSS: Attractive styling with color themes, priority labels, and a modern dark mode option. Smooth animations and transitions to provide visual feedback when tasks are added, removed, or marked as completed.

JavaScript: Core logic for adding, editing, and removing tasks. Handles dark mode state and persists data in LocalStorage. Ensures task priorities are saved and styled correctly. Project Files and Code Organization

HTML (index.html): The structure and UI elements of the to-do list app.

CSS (styles.css): Styling for the interface, including dark mode, task priorities, and animations.

JavaScript (app.js): Contains all the logic for managing tasks, dark mode, and LocalStorage.

How the App Works Adding a Task:
Enter a task in the input field, select a priority, and click the "Add" button (or press Enter). The task appears in the list with the selected priority color. Editing and Removing Tasks:

Click the Edit button to modify a task. Use the Remove button to delete a task from the list. Task Completion:

Click on a task to mark it as completed (adds a strikethrough). Dark Mode:

Toggle dark mode using the switch, and the preference is saved for future sessions. Persistent Data:

All tasks are saved in LocalStorage, and the dark mode preference is retained. What Makes This App Unique? Priority-based Task Management: Helps users organize tasks by importance. Dark Mode with Persistence: Allows better usability across environments. Interactive Animations: Transitions and animations create a smooth experience. Persistent Data: No need to worry about refreshing the pageâ€”tasks stay safe! Potential Future Enhancements Due Dates: Add date-pickers to set deadlines for tasks. Notifications: Alert users about upcoming tasks or deadlines. Categories/Tags: Allow grouping tasks into projects or categories. Progress Tracker: Display percentage of completed tasks.
